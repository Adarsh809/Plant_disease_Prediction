# Plant Disease Prediction using CNN

#Overview- 
This project aims to predict plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It leverages a dataset of plant images, categorizing them into healthy and diseased classes to identify common plant diseases. The model helps farmers and agriculturists take early measures for disease management and improve crop health.

#Project Description-
In this project, we have built a CNN-based deep learning model to classify various plant diseases. The goal is to provide a fast, accurate solution for identifying plant diseases from images, making it easier to intervene early and minimize damage to crops.

#Dataset-
A kaggle dataset used in this project includes images of different plants with healthy and diseased categories. It consists of images grouped by plant species and disease types.
